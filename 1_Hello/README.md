# 1_Hello

## Compiling
For this exercise you only need the basic compiler. The [shell script](compile.sh) has all the necessary instructions to compile, but you should familiarize yourself with its steps. The script can then be ran from the command line with `./compile.sh` (macOS usually requires the `./`; if an issue arises with just getting the script to execute, try removing those characters).

## Executing `Hello`
The compilation should have produced an executable `Hello`. It can be run in the same was as the shell script, except it takes in an (optional) argument,
```shell
./Hello [NAME]
```
 Try it out!
